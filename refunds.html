    Kisor Chandra Biswal believes in helping its customers as far as possible,
    and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:
  </p>
  <ul class="unorder-list">
    <li class="list-item">
      <p class="content-text list-text">
        Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within
        2 days of placing the order. However, the cancellation request
        may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to
        the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="list-item">
      <p class="content-text list-text">
        Kisor Chandra Biswal does not accept cancellation
        requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables etc.
        However, refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes
        that the quality of product delivered is not good.
      </p>

      <p class="content-text list-text">
        In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report the
        same to our Customer Service team. The request will, however,
        be entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the
        same at his own end. This should be reported within
        2 days of receipt of the
        products.
      </p>

    <li class="list-item">
      <p class="content-text list-text">
        In case you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site
        or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our
        customer service within 2 days of
        receiving the product. The Customer Service Team after looking into your
        complaint will take an appropriate decision.
